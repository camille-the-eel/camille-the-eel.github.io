    <h1>Camille Hughes</h1>
    <h2>Designer. Developer. Illustrator.</h2>
    <p>Edit me later to include developer/UR. Camille Hughes is a designer, illustrator, and printmaker based out of Richmond, Virginia. She works primarily through a blend of digital and traditional media. Camille completed a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Communication Arts from Virginia Commonwealth University in 2015 and has since then used her graphic design skills in freelance projects and enjoys her studio space at local art and printmaking hub, Studio Two Three. Outside of her artistic endeavors, she has a joy of the outdoors, captivation for critters of any kind, and a continuous desire to experience the unknown and unfamiliar.</p>
